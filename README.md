# JammingTheCurve
# This project is part of a game jam that shows how covid spreads.
# NPCs have health and an armour rating depending on if they have masks on or not
# The round is timed and as the covid virus you go around touching and or atacking objects and NPCs.
# At the end of the round a score is tallied and displayed
